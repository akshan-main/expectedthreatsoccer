# Exprected Threat in Soccer

xT in soccer, though not as mainstream as xG, is yet a valuable stat while analysing player performances.
xT is more potent that xG as it also factors in the build-up leading to the goal. While xG is useful in determining the capabilities of an individual player and their scoring prowess, xT reflects the same but with respect to compatibility with rest of the team and the system employed by the team manager

In this project, I have analyzed the performance of Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford in the Europa League final against Villareal on 27 May 2021.

Data collected from:
fbref, statbomb

The file "expected_threat.csv" is based on "Explaining Expected Threat" by David Sumpter. It follows the grid of xT at various zones across the football pitch.
